# Webpack

This is not part of any exercises from part7. This code is the result of following through the theory of the webpack chapter - [https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7/webpack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7/webpack). I decided to add this code to solutions, because I found it easier to understand the topic this way and as a potential future reference.

To start the webpack application locally:

```console
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the JSON server that is in development mode
npm run server

# Start the application in development mode with webpack-dev-server
npm start

# Build the application in production mode
npm run build
```
