# Part1

In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the React-library, which we will be using to write the code that runs in the browser. We will also look at some features of JavaScript that are important for understanding React.

# Applications

There is one seperate React application built with Create React App in each of the folders.

```console
# Install dependencies
yarn install
# Start the application
yarn start
```
